# BioinformHER-Module-1-Mini-Project
Mini Project: Comprehensive Sequence
Analysis of the Human TNF Gene
This mini project focuses on the Comprehensive Sequence Analysis of the Human TNF Gene, with the objective of applying bioinformatics techniques to analyze the TNF gene, which encodes the proinflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF). The project involves a series of bioinformatics tasks, including downloading the TNF gene sequence, translating it into its corresponding protein sequence, and identifying open reading frames (ORFs). Additionally, the analysis includes examining nucleotide and amino acid composition, determining GC content, identifying potential transcription factor binding sites, and searching for functional motifs. The final task is to predict coding and non-coding regions using gene prediction tools. By integrating these analyses, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the TNF gene's structure, function, and regulatory elements.
