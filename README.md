# BioinformHER-Module-1-Mini-Project
Mini Project: Comprehensive Sequence
Analysis of the Human TNF Gene

This mini-project focuses on the comprehensive sequence analysis of the human TNF gene, with the goal of applying bioinformatics techniques to study the gene that encodes the proinflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF). The project involves several bioinformatics tasks, including downloading the TNF gene sequence from NCBI, translating it into its corresponding protein sequence using BioEdit, and identifying open reading frames (ORFs). Additionally, the analysis includes examining nucleotide and amino acid composition, determining GC content, identifying potential transcription factor binding sites using the PROMO tool, and searching for functional motifs with the MEME Suite. The final task is to predict coding and non-coding regions using GENSCAN. By integrating these analyses, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the TNF gene's structure, function, and regulatory elements.
